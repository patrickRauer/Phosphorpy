# Phosphorpy
Phosphorpy is python package to mine large photometric sky surveys. 
It is designed to allow to do common and regular task, which are done if
the large photometric data sets are used, in just few lines. 
The aim is to provide a simple interface to make such data sets and 
speially data set combination more accessable to the community.

The core structure is base don the common data science python packge
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), which provides huge amount of 
functionalities to takle data science tasks. In the case of **Phosphorpy**
the usage of [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) allows everyone to 
work on more difficult chanlenges
without converting data. Also it allows to modify **Phosphorpy**
for a multi-core/cluster run by switchen from 
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) to spark with some limitations.
